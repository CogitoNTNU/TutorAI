## Architectural tactics and patterns

## Architectural Viewpoints

### Physical View
*The physical view should describe how the software is allocated to
hardware. This includes the client, the server, and network connections you develop
and other services you use (like cloud-based services, etc.). A typical notation for this
view is a deployment diagram.*

### Logical View
*It is recommended to use multiple diagrams for this view, e.g., provide
one high-level diagram and one or more diagrams for more detail. Typical notations
for this view include a UML class diagram, UML package diagram, layers diagram,
ER diagram, and combination of UML class and package diagrams.*

### Process View
*It is also recommended to use multiple diagrams for the view to give a
complete description of the run-time behavior of the system. Typical notations for this
view include a UML activity diagram, a UML state diagram, and a UML sequence
diagram.*

### Development View
*The purpose of the development view is to make it easier to
allocate work to various team members and make it possible to allow development in
parallel. Based on this view, it should be easy to give programming tasks to group
members and make it easy to integrate the results after completion with the rest of the
system*
