## How does TutorAI find similar expiriences/cases to what the user requests?


TutorAI uses a blend of traditional similarity and knowledge intensive similarity measures. 
It uses models to embeddify the content of curriuculum and the user query.

An embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. 
The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. 
Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.
